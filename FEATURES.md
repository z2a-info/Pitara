# Pitara Features

## Google-like Search
Modern cell phones and cameras capture more than just images – they embed valuable data like location, timestamp, and more into your photos. **Pitara** intelligently processes and indexes this data, allowing you to instantly search for photos using combinations of keywords like:

- `From 10 years Summer weekend 7:30 PM`
- `Christmas Hawaii`
- `Oregon 2002`
- `Cute long hair`
- `15kfeet` (photos taken at 15,000 feet)

The possibilities are endless. Check out a list of sample searches to learn more.
